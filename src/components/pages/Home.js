                        I am a current senior attending UW-Madison where I am majoring in History, Computer Science, and Information Science.
                        I will be graduating in May of 2024. After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in the emerging field of digital history.
                        I am passionate about ensuring the accessibility of historical information, whether this be online or in person.

                        My historical interests include precolonial and colonial Latin America. I will be furthering this interest through my
                        Senior Honor's Thesis on the roles of gender, race, caste, and religion during the Inquisition in colonial Nueva Granada,
                        or modern-day Colombia. For my thesis, I have been awarded the competitive Hilldale Undergraduate Research Fellowship, as 
                        well as a Senior Thesis Summer Research Grant through the Honor's program at UW.

                        Throughout my time at UW-Madison, I have been involved in a variety of organizations, both in the field of computer science, 
                        and the field of history. These are highlighted under the "School Work" and "Career History" tabs above. 
                        I have also been recognized for my acadmic achievements through multiple awards and honors, also highlighted above.
