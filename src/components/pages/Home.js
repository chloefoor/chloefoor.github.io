            <h1>Hi everyone, my name is Chloe Foor</h1>
            <p>
                I am a current senior attending UW-Madison where I am majoring in History, Computer Science, and Information Science.
                I will be graduating in May of 2024. After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in the emerging field of digital history.
                I am passionate about ensuring the accessibility of historical information, whether this be online or in person.
                My historical interests include precolonial and colonial Latin America. I will be furthering this interest through my
                senior honor's thesis on the roles of gender, race, caste, and religion during the Inquisition in colonial Nueva Granada,
                or modern-day Colombia. For my thesis, I have been awarded the competitive Hilldale Undergraduate Research Fellowship, as 
                well as a Senior Thesis Summer Research Grant through the Honor's program at UW.

                Throughout my time at UW-Madison, I have been involved in a variety of organizations. I am currently the Vice President of
                Phi Alpha Theta, the History Honor's Society. In this role, I work to foster a community of history students and faculty. 
                I also have experience in archival research through my work as a Student Historian with the UW Archives. Here, I work to research 
                underrepresented and underresearched populations at UW-Madison and create exhibits to highlight their stories.                
            </p>

                My computer science centered interest lie in web development and human-computer interaction. I am currently working as the 
                Web Designer and Student Coordinator for the Nonviolence Project, a history-centered project that employs students to research 
                nonviolence and create a collection of well-researched and reliable sources on nonviolence. 
                For the last two years, I have also worked as a Peer Mentor with Wisconsin Emerging Scholars in Computer Science, an 
                organization that works to increase diversity in the field of computer science. In this role, I worked with a group of 
                students to help them navigate the computer science major and the UW-Madison campus.
