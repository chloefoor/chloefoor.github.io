                    I am writing my senior honors thesis in history on the impacts of race, gender, caste, and religion on the Inquisition 
                    in colonial Nueva Granada, or modern-day Colombia. This process will be advised by Dr. Marcella Hayes.

                <p>
                    In anticipation of my thesis, I have been awarded the Hilldale Fellowship and the 
                    Senior Thesis Summer Research Grant through the Honor's program at UW-Madison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward to sharing my research with you all in the future!
