            <p>
                I knew that I wanted to study Computer Science since I was in middle school.
                My primary interest is the applications of technology on historical research, but I am also interested in
                web development and human-computer interaction.

            <h1>Information Science</h1>
            <p>
                My interest in Information Science began once I started learning more about the field of digital history. I believe that Information Science 
                is a great complement to my Computer Science major, as it allows me to learn more about the social and cultural implications of technology, as 
                well as how technology can be applied to historical research.
