            <p>
                I am incredibly passionate about ensuring the accessibility of reliable historical information, whether this be online or in person. 
                In the future, I hope to enter the new field of digital history. The UW-Madison History Department has allowed me to explore my interests 
                and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities I have been given.

            <h2>Senior Honor's Thesis</h2>
            <p>
                I will be working on completing my Senior Honor's Thesis during the upcoming school year. I will be researching the roles that gender, race, caste, 
                and religion played during the Inquisition in colonial Nueva Granada, or modern-day Colombia. I will be working with Dr. Marcella Hayes, a 
                historian of Colonial Latin America to complete my research. I have been awarded the Hilldale Undergraduate Research Fellowship and the 
                Senior Thesis Summer Research Grant for my thesis, which will allow me to travel to Colombia to conduct research in various archives in August of 2023. 
                To complete this, I have been practicing both my Spanish and my paleography skills. I am incredibly excited to begin this project!
