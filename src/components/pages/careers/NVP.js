                <h3>Student Coordinator</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Student Coordinator with the Nonviolence Project, I help to manage a group of 10 research interns. This includes 
                    keeping them accountable for their work, as well as helping them to develop their research and writing skills through 
                    proofreading their articles and their citations. I also help to schedule 
                    meetings among the interns and the project's faculty advisor, Dr. Mou Banerjee. During the fall, I also help in the hiring 
                    and onboarding of new research interns.

                <h3>Web Designer</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Web Designer with the Nonviolence Project, I am responsible for the design and maintenance of the project's website. 
                    Whenever researchers complete their articles, I am responsible for uploading them to the website and ensuring that they are 
                    formatted correctly. I also ensure that the website is up to date with the latest information about the project and is in 
                    accordance with modern accessibility standards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also spearheaded the creation of a monthly newsletter for the project. This newsletter is sent out to all of its 
                    subscribers and includes any new articles, a spotlight on a researcher, and any new happenings with the project.
