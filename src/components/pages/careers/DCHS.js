                    Beginning in January 2023, I have worked as a Digital Specialist with the Dane County Historical Society. 
                    In this position, I have worked on adding metadata to the Kronenberg Collection, which consists of architectural 
                    drawings by the Madison-based architect, William F. Kronenberg. I have also worked on digitizing a series of oral 
                    history interviews conducted by Historic Madison Inc. in the late 1900s.

                    In my spare time at DCHS, I have also worked on modernizing and updating its website to be in accordance with 
                    modern accessibility standards.
