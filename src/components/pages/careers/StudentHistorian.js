                    I am pleased to share that I have been rehired as student historian for another school year, where I will be conducting 
                    another year-long research project on the history of underrepresented students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

                    The Student Historian position is a year-long job where a student conducts a research project on an underrepresented population 
                    in the history of UW. I conducted a project on queer students at UW and their relationships with religion. 
                    I created a website to showcase my research, which can be found <a href="https://www.library.wisc.edu/archives/archives/student-historian-program/current-student-historians-chloe-foor/">here</a>.
