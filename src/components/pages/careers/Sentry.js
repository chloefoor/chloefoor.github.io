                    I worked as an Associate Software Developer with Sentry Insurance for a year, working full-time over the summer and 
                    part-time during the school year. Most of my time here was spent updating deprecated methods to migrate over to 
                    Java Persistence API, a query language, instead of the outdated Hibernate methods. At the end of the summer, I presented 
                    an overview of my work to a group of about 30 coworkers.

                    I also worked with SonarLint and SonarQube a lot to clean up existing code and improve its readability. During my last month 
                    at Sentry, I used C# and front-end languages to create a new web page for the company.

                    Since this position was entirely remote during the time I was at Sentry, I developed many self-motivation and self-management 
                    skills. I also learned how to work in a professional environment, and how to communicate effectively with my coworkers.
