                    Wisconsin Emerging Scholars in Computer Science (or WES-CS) is a program that supports students from underrepresented 
                    backgrounds in computer science. I work as a peer mentor with WES-CS, where I lead a 2 hour class once a week to a small 
                    group of students, helping them grow in confidence and knowledge in computer science by reinforcing principles they 
                    learn in their introductory computer science courses. During my time with WES-CS, I have learned how to be a better teacher 
                    and mentor. I have also learned how to be more patient and understanding with others, and how to communicate more effectively.

                    I also represent WES-CS during SOAR, or summer orientation for new UW students. I give a presentation to incoming students 
                    about the program, and I answer any questions they may have about the program or computer science in general. I have also sat 
                    in on meetings with the computer science department and the Center for Academic Excellence where they discuss WES-CS programming 
                    and how to improve it.
