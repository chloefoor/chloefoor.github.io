                    I spent the summer of 2022 working as a Public History Intern at the Historic Indian Agency House in Portage, Wisconsin.
                    Here, I led tours of the historic house, which was built in 1832 as a federal Indian agency and educated 
                    visitors on the history of Ho-Chunk in the region. I also worked on a variety of archival tasks, such as digitizing 
                    records associated with the Colonial Dames of America, recording objects on PastPerfect, a collection management tool, 
                    and preparing condition reports on dozens of objects in the museum's collection.

                    In August, the Agency House held an Archeological Dig, where members of the community could come to the grounds of the museum and 
                    were able to dig for artifacts. I was able to assist with this event, and was able to learn more about the archeological process. 
                    I also created a display for the Dig showcasing some of the artifacts that had been found in previous years and gave historical context 
                    to those artifacts.
